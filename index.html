            <div class="statistics">
              Naeem began playing tennis at the age of 6. He started competing
              in USTA tournaments when he was 9 years old and began winning
              Midwest level events and gained national recognition shortly
              after. He has consistently been ranked among the top 10 players in
              Michigan and has been awarded numerous accolades from the USTA. In
              high school, Naeem was selected to play the #1 singles position
              for his varsity team for four straight years and led his team to
              the State Finals three times out of four. He was a 2-time
              All-State Honorable Mention awardee and received All-State (among
              the most prestigious awards given by the MHSAA) his senior year.

              Vishwaas has been a varsity player ever since his freshman year of
              high school. He was an integral part of the team and was
              responsible for leading them to three State Finals appearances. He
              has consistently had a winning record throughout high school and
              was responsible for being the first person in Canton High School
              to earn a point at the State Championships. In his senior year, he
              finished the season with an impressive 18-2 record and as the
              captain, led his team to States for the third time.

              David just concluded his final year of high school where he has
              played the #1 singles position for three consecutive years. He has
              participated in numerous USTA tournaments and his spectacular
              league record has made him a top 20 player in Michigan. In his
              senior year of high school, he reached the semifinals of the State
              Finals at the #2 singles position, making him the only player from
              Plymouth High School to accomplish this feat at the State
              Championships. As a result, he was awarded the All-State Honorable
              Mention Award from the MHSAA.
